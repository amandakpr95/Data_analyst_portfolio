## Here I demonstrate some commonly used functions for data visualization using 
## commonly used R packages, "tidyverse" and "ggplot2", as well as the commonly used
## dataset, "palmerpenguins"

install.packages("tidyverse")           # installing the packages
install.packages("ggplot2")
library("ggplot2")                      # loading the packages
library("palmerpenguins")

ggplot(data = penguins) +               
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  labs(title = "Palmer Penguins: Body Mass vs. Flipper Length", subtitle = "Sample of Three Penguin Species", 
       caption = "Data collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman, 2007-2009") + 
  annotate("text", x = 220, y = 3500, label = "The Gentoos are the largest")

## "ggplot" tells R what data we're using
## "geom_point" tells R to make a scatter plot, i.e. point
## "mapping = aes" determines where we map the variables in the plot.
## "geom_smooth" creates a trend line through our points, highlighting correlative results
## "labs" adds labels to the graph, like the title, subtitle, and caption
## "annotate" creates the floating text "Gentoos are the largest" over the graph.
